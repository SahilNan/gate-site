Question:
Let T be a full binary tree with 8 leaves. (A full binary tree has every level full.) Suppose
two leaves a and b of T are chosen uniformly and independently at random. The expected
value of the distance between a and b in T (i.e., the number of edges in the unique path
between a and b) is (rounded off to 2 decimal places) ____.

Question:
Suppose Y is distributed uniformly in the open interval (1,6). The probability that the
polynomial 3x<sup>2</sup> + 6xY + 3Y + 6 has only real roots is (rounded off to 1 decimal place)
 ____.

Question:
Let &sum; be the set of all bijections from {1,...,5} to {1,...,5}, where id denotes the identity
function, i.e. id(j) =j,&forall;j. Let &deg; denote composition on functions. For a string x =
x<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2</sub> ...x<sub>n</sub>, &isin &sum;<sup>n</sup>, n &ge; 0, let &pi;(x) = x<sub>1</sub> &deg; x<sub>2</sub>&deg; ...&deg; x<sub>n</sub>.
Consider the language L = {x &isin; &sum;<sup>*</sup>| &pi;(x) = id}. The minimum number of states in any
DFA accepting L is ____.

Question:
Consider that 15 machines need to be connected in a LAN using 8-port Ethernet switches.
Assume that these switches do not have any separate uplink ports. The minimum number of
switches needed is ____.

Question:
What is the minimum number of 2-input NOR gates required to implement a 4-variable
function expressed in sum-of-minterms form as f= &sum;(0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15)? Assume that
all the inputs and their complements are available. Answer: ____ .

Question:
A relational database contains two tables Student and Performance as shown below:

    Student              Performance
  Roll_no Student_name  Roll_no Subject_code  Marks
  1       Amit          1       A             86
  2       Priya         1       B             95
  3       Vinit         1       C             90
  4       Rohan         2       A             89
  5       Smita         2       C             92
                        3       C             80

The primary key of the Student table is Roll_no. For the Performance table, the columns
Roll_no. and Subject_code together form the primary key. Consider the SQL query given
below:

SELECT S.Student_name, sum(P.Marks)
FROM Student S, Performance P
WHERE P.Marks > 84
GROUP BY S.Student_name;

The number of rows returned by the above SQL query is ____.

Question:
Consider the following C program:

<code>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(){
        float sum = 0.0, j = 1.0, i = 2.0;
        while (i/j > 0.0625){
            j = j + j;
            sum = sum + i/j;
            printf("%f\n", sum);
        }
        return 0;
    }
</code>

The number of times the variable sum will be printed, when the above program is executed,
is ____.

Question:
Consider the following C program:

<code>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        int a[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
        int i, sum = 0, *b = a + 4;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            sum = sum + (*b - i) - *(b - i);
        printf ("%d\n", sum);
        return 0;
    }
</code>

The output of the above C program is ____.

Question:
In an RSA cryptosystem, the value of the public modulus parameter n is 3007. If it is also
known that &phi;(n) = 2880, where &phi;() denotes Euler's Totient Function, then the prime factor
of n which is greater than 50 is ____.

Question:
Consider the following relations P(X, Y, Z), Q(X, Y, T) and R(Y, V).

      P            Q               R
  X   Y   Z     X    Y   T      Y     V
 X1   Y1  Z1    X2   Y1  2     Y1     V1
