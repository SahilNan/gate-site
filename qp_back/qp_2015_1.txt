Question:
An algorithm performs (log N)<sup>1/2</sup> find operations, N insert operations, (log N)<sup>1/2</sup> delete
operations, and (log N)<sup>1/2</sup> decrease-key operations on a set of data items with keys drawn from a
linearly ordered set. For a delete operation, a pointer is provided to the record that must be deleted.
For the decrease-key operation, a pointer is provided to the record that has its key decreased. Which
one of the following data structures is the most suited for the algorithm to use, if the goal is to
achieve the best total asymptotic complexity considering all the operations?
Options:
(A) Unsorted array 
(B) Min-heap
(C) Sorted array 
(D) Sorted doubly linked list

Question:
Consider the following relations:

Roll_no Course   Marks
1       Math     80
1       English  70
2       Math     75
3       English  80
2       Physics  65
3       Math     80

Consider the following SQL query.

SELECT S.Student_Name, sum(P.Marks)
FROM Student S, Performance P
WHERE S.Roll No = P.Roll No

Question:
The graph shown below has 8 edges with distinct integer edge weights. The minimum spanning tree
(MST) is of weight 36 and contains the edges: {(A, C), (B, C), (B, E), (E, F), (D, F)}. The edge
weights of only those edges which are in the MST are given in the figure shown below. The
minimum possible sum of weights of all 8 edges of this graph is ____
