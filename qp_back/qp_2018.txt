Question:
Consider the following solution to the producer-consumer synchronization problem. The 
shared buffer size is N. Three semaphores empty,  full and mutex are defined with respective 
initial values of 0, N and 1. Semaphore empty denotes the number of available slots in the 
buffer, for the consumer to read from. Semaphore full denotes the number of available slots 
in the buffer, for the producer to write to. The placeholder variables, denoted by P, Q, R, 
and S, in the code below can be assigned either empty or full. The valid semaphore 
operations are: wait() and signal(). 

<code>
Producer:              Consumer: 

do{                    do{ 
    wait(P);               wait(R); 
    wait(mutex);           wait(mutex); 
    //Add item to buffer   //Consume item from buffer 
    signal(mutex);         signal(mutex); 
    signal(Q);             signal(S); 
}while(1);              }while(1);

the numbers 1,2, ... , 100.  There is an edge between vertices u and v if and only if the label

Question:
Consider Guwahati (G) and Delhi (D) whose temperatures can be classified as high (H), 
medium (M) and low (L). Let P(H<sub>G</sub>) denote the probability that Guwahati has high 
temperature. Similarly, P(M<sub>G</sub>) and P(L<sub>G</sub>) denotes the probability of Guwahati having 
medium and low temperatures respectively. Similarly, we use P(H<sub>D</sub>), P(M<sub>D</sub>) and P(L<sub>D</sub>) for 
Delhi.  

The following table gives the conditional probabilities for Delhi's temperature given 
Guwahati's temperature. 

    H<sub>D</sub>     M<sub>D</sub>     L<sub>D</sub> 
H<sub>G</sub>  0.40   0.48   0.12 
M<sub>G</sub>  0.10   0.65   0.25 
L<sub>G</sub>  0.01   0.50   0.49 

Consider the first row in the table above. The first entry denotes that if Guwahati has high 
temperature (H<sub>G</sub>) then the probability of Delhi also having a high temperature (H<sub>D</sub>) is 0.40; 
i.e., P(H<sub>D</sub>|H<sub>G</sub>) = 0.40. Similarly, the next two entries are P(M<sub>D</sub>|H<sub>G</sub>) = 0.48 and 
P(L<sub>D</sub>|H<sub>G</sub>) = 0.12. Similarly for the other rows.  

If it is known that P(H<sub>G</sub>) = 0.2, P(M<sub>G</sub>) = 0.5, and P(L<sub>G</sub>) = 0.3, then the probability 
(correct to two decimal places) that Guwahati has high temperature given that Delhi has high 
temperature is ____.

Question:
Consider a storage disk with 4 platters (numbered as 0, 1, 2 and 3), 200 cylinders (numbered 
as 0, 1, ... , 199), and 256 sectors per track (numbered as 0, 1, ... , 255). The following 6 
disk requests of the form [sector number, cylinder number, platter number] are received by 
the disk controller at the same time:

Currently the head is positioned at sector number 100 of cylinder 80, and is moving towards 
higher cylinder numbers. The average power dissipation in moving the head over 100 
cylinders is 20 milliwatts and for reversing the direction of the head movement once is 15 
milliwatts. Power dissipation associated with rotational latency and switching of head 
between different platters is negligible.

Shortest Seek Time First disk scheduling algorithm is ____. 
 

Question:
Consider an IP packet with a length of 4,500 bytes that includes a 20-byte IPv4 header and 
a 40-byte TCP header. The packet is forwarded to an IPv4 router that supports a Maximum 
Transmission Unit (MTU) of 600 bytes. Assume that the length of the IP header in all the 
outgoing fragments of this packet is 20 bytes. Assume that the fragmentation offset value 
stored in the first fragment is 0.  

The fragmentation offset value stored in the third fragment is ____. 

Question:
Consider a simple communication system where multiple nodes are connected by a shared 
broadcast medium (like Ethernet or wireless). The nodes in the system use the following 
carrier-sense based medium access protocol. A node that receives a packet to transmit will 
carrier-sense the medium for 5 units of time. If the node does not detect any other 
transmission in this duration, it starts transmitting its packet in the next time unit. If the node 
detects another transmission, it waits until this other transmission finishes, and then begins 
to carrier-sense for 5 time units again. Once they start to transmit, nodes do not perform any 
collision detection and continue transmission even if a collision occurs. All transmissions 
last for 20 units of time. Assume that the transmission signal travels at the speed of 10 meters 
per unit time in the medium.  

Assume that the system has two nodes P and Q, located at a distance d meters from each 
other. P starts transmitting a packet at time t=0 after successfully completing its carrier-sense 
phase. Node Q has a packet to transmit at time t=0 and begins to carrier-sense the medium.  

The maximum distance d (in meters, rounded to the closest integer) that allows Q to 
successfully avoid a collision between its proposed transmission and P's ongoing 
transmission is ____.
