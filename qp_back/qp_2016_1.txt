Question:
Consider the following two phase locking protocol. Suppose a transaction T accesses (for
read or write operations), a certain set of objects {O<sub>1</sub>, . . . ,O<sub>k</sub>}. This is done in the following
manner:

    Step 1. T acquires exclusive locks to O<sub>1</sub>, . . . , O<sub>k</sub> in increasing order of their addresses.
    Step 2. The required operations are performed.
    Step 3. All locks are released.

This protocol will
Options:
(A) guarantee serializability and deadlock-freedom
(B) guarantee neither serializability nor deadlock-freedom
(C) guarantee serializability but not deadlock-freedom
(D) guarantee deadlock-freedom but not serializability

Question:
Consider that B wants to send a message m that is digitally signed to A. Let the pair of private
and public keys for A and B be denoted by K<sub>x</sub><sup>-</sup> and K<sub>x</sub><sup>+</sup> for x = A,B, respectively. Let K<sub>x</sub>(m)
represent the operation of encrypting m with a key K<sub>x</sub> and H(m) represent the message digest.
Which one of the following indicates the CORRECT way of sending the message m along
with the digital signature to A?
Options:
(A) {m,K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup>(H(m))} 
(B) {m,K<sub>B</sub><sup>-</sup>(H(m))} 
(C) {m,K<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup>(H(m))} 
(D) {m,K<sub>B</sub><sup>+</sup>(m)}

Question:
An IP datagram of size 1000 bytes arrives at a router. The router has to forward this packet on
a link whose MTU (maximum transmission unit) is 100 bytes. Assume that the size of the IP
header is 20 bytes.
The number of fragments that the IP datagram will be divided into for transmission is
 ____.

Question:
For a host machine that uses the token bucket algorithm for congestion control, the token
bucket has a capacity of 1 megabyte and the maximum output rate is 20 megabytes per second.
Tokens arrive at a rate to sustain output at a rate of 10 megabytes per second. The token bucket
is currently full and the machine needs to send 12 megabytes of data. The minimum time
required to transmit the data is ____ seconds.

Question:
A sender uses the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol for reliable transmission of frames. Frames
are of size 1000 bytes and the transmission rate at the sender is 80 Kbps (1Kbps = 1000
bits/second). Size of an acknowledgement is 100 bytes and the transmission rate at the receiver
is 8 Kbps. The one-way propagation delay is 100 milliseconds.
Assuming no frame is lost, the sender throughput is ____ bytes/second.
