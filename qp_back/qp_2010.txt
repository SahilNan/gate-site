Question:
Consider a network with G routers R1 to R6 connected with links having weights as shown in the
following diagram.

<img src="img/2010_54.png" width="100px" height="100px" />

All the routers use the distance vector based routing algorithm to update their routing tables. Each
router starts with its routing table initialized to contain an entry for each neighbour with the weight
of the respective connecting link. After all the routing tables stabilize, how many links in the
network will never be used for carrying any data?
Options:
(A) 4 
(B) 3 
(C) 2 
(D) 1

vector algorithm is used again until all routing tables stabilize. How many links will now remain
unused?
