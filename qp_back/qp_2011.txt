Question:
On a non-pipelined sequential processor, a program segment, which is a part of the interrupt service
routine, is given to transfer 500 bytes from an I/O device to memory.

          Initialize the address register
          Initialize the count to 500
    LOOP: Load a byte from device
          Store in memory at address given by address register
          Increment the address register
          Decrement the count
          If count != 0 go to LOOP

Assume that each statement in this program is equivalent to a machine instruction which takes one
clock cycle to execute if it is a non-load/store instruction. The load-store instructions take two clock
cycles to execute.

The designer of the system also has an alternate approach of using the DMA controller to
implement the same transfer. The DMA controller requires 20 clock cycles for initialization and
other overheads. Each DMA transfer cycle takes two clock cycles to transfer one byte of data from
the device to the memory.

What is the approximate speedup when the DMA controller based design is used in place of the
interrupt driven program based input-output?

Question:
The following is the comment written for a C function.

/* This function computes the roots of a quadratic equation
   a.x^2 + b.x + c = 0. The function stores two real roots
   in *root1 and *root2 and returns the status of validity
   of roots. It handles four different kinds of cases.
   (i) When coefficient a is zero irrespective of discriminant
   (ii) When discriminant is positive
   (iii) When discriminant is zero
   (iv) When discriminant is negative.
   Only in case (ii) and (iii), the stored roots are valid.
   Otherwise 0 is stored in the roots. The function returns
   0 when the roots are valid and -1 otherwise.
   The function also ensures rootl >= root2.
   int get_QuadRoots(float a, float b, float c,
       float *root1l, float *root2);

Question:
Consider a network with five nodes, N1 to N5, as shown below.

<img src="img/2011_52.png" width="100px" height="100px" />

The network uses a Distance Vector Routing protocol. Once the routes have stabilized, the distance vectors
at different nodes are as following.

N1: (0, 1, 7, 8, 4)
N2: (1, 0, 6, 7, 3)
N3: (7, 6, 0, 2, 6)
N4: (8, 7, 2, 0, 4)
N5: (4, 3, 6, 4, 0)
Each distance vector is the distance of the best known path at that instance to nodes, N1 to N5, where the
distance to itself is 0. Also, all links are symmetric and the cost is identical in both directions. In each
round, all nodes exchange their distance vectors with their respective neighbors. Then all nodes update
their distance vectors. In between two rounds, any change in cost of a link will cause the two incident
nodes to change only that entry in their distance vectors.

The cost of link N2-N3 reduces to 2 (in both directions). After the next round of updates, what will
be the new distance vector at node, N3?
Options:
(A) (3, 2, 0, 2, 5) 
(B) (3, 2, 0, 2, 6) 
(C) (7, 2, 0, 2, 5) 
(D) (7, 2, 0, 2, 6)

The cost of link N2-N3 reduces to 2 (in both directions). After the next round of updates, there will
be the new distance vector at node, N3, the link N1-N2 goes down. N2 will reflect this change
immediately in its distance vector as cost, &infin;. After the NEXT ROUND of update, what will be the
cost to N1 in the distance vector of N3?
Options:
