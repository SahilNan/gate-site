value of t is ____.

Question:
A function f(x) is continuous in the interval [0,2]. It is known that f(0) = f(2) = -1 and
f(1) = 1.Which one of the following statements must be true?  

Options:
(A) There exists a y in the interval (0,1)  such that f(y) = f(y + 1)
(B) For every y in the  interval (0,1), f(y) = f(2 - y)

Question:
Four fair six-sided dice are rolled. The probability that the sum of the results being 22 is X/1296. 
The value of X is ____.
  
Question:
A pennant is a sequence of numbers, each number being 1 or 2. An n-pennant is a sequence of 
numbers with sum equal to n. For example, (1,1,2) is a 4-pennant. The set of all possible 1-pennants 
is {(1)}, the set of all possible 2-pennants is {(2), (1,1)}and the set of all 3-pennants is {(2,1), 
(1,1,1), (1,2)}. Note that the pennant (1,2) is not the same as the pennant (2,1).  The number of 10-
pennants is ____.
 
Question:

from S to the set {0,1}. The value of log<sub>2</sub> log<sub>2</sub> N  is ____.
 
Question:
Consider an undirected graph where self-loops are not allowed.The vertex set of G is {(i,j): 1 &le;
 i &le; 12, 1 &le; j &le; 12}.There is an edge between (a,b) and (c,d) if |a - c| &le; 1 and |b - d| &le; 1. 
The number of edges in this graph is ____.
  
Question:
An ordered n-tuple (d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, ... ,d<sub>n</sub>) with d<sub>1</sub> &ge; d<sub>2</sub> &ge; ..., &ge; d<sub>n</sub> is called graphic if there exists4 a simple 
undirected graph with n vertices having degrees d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, ... ,d<sub>n</sub> respectively. Which of the following 
6-tuples is NOT graphic?
Options:
(A) (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) 
(B) (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) 
(C) (3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0)

Question:
Which one of the following propositional logic formulas is TRUE when exactly two of p, q, and  
r are TRUE?
Options:
(A) ((p &harr; q) &and; r) &or; (p &and; q &and; &sim;r)
(B) (&sim;(p &harr; q) &and; r) &or; (p &and; q &and; &sim;r)
(C) ((p &rarr; q) &and; r) &or; (p &and; q &and; &sim;r)

Question:
Given the following schema:

 employees(emp-id, first-name, last-name, hire-date, 
               dept-id, salary) 
 departments(dept-id, dept-name, manager-id, location-id) 

You want to display the last names and hire dates of all latest hires in their respective departments 
in the location ID 1700. You issue the following query: 

SQL>SELECT last-name, hire-date 
    FROM employees  
    WHERE (dept-id, hire-date) IN 
    (SELECT dept-id, MAX(hire-date) 
    FROM employees JOIN departments USING(dept-id)  )
    WHERE location-id = 1700 
    GROUP BY dept-id);

What is the outcome?
Options:
(A) It executes but does not give the correct result. 
(B) It executes and gives the correct result.
(C) It generates an error because of pairwise comparison.  
(D) It generates an error because the GROUP BY clause cannot be used with table joins in a sub-
    query. 

Question:
Consider two processors P1 and P2 executing the same instruction set. Assume that under identical 
conditions, for the same input, a program running on P2 takes 25% less time but incurs 20% more 
CPI (clock cycles per instruction() as compared to the program running on P1. If the clock frequency 
of P1 is 1GHz, then the clock  frequency of P2 (in GHz) is ____.
