I-cache    2                  0.8
D-cache    2                  0.9

word-first read policy andthe write back policy. Assume that all the caches are direct mapped
caches. Assume that the dirty bit is always 0 for all the blocks in the caches. In execution of a
program, 60% of memory reads are for instruction fetch and 40% are for memory operand fetch.
