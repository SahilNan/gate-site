Question:
An instruction pipeline has five stages, namely, instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode and 
register fetch (ID/RF), instruction execution (EX), memory access (MEM), and register writeback 
(WB) with stage latencies 1 ns, 2.2 ns, 2 ns, 1 ns, and 0.75 ns, respectively (ns stands for 
nanoseconds). To gain in terms of frequency, the designers have decided to split the ID/RF stage 
into three stages (ID, RF31, RF2) each of latency 2.2/3 ns. Also, the EX stage is split into two stages 
(EX1, EX2) each of latency 1 ns. The new design has a total of eight pipeline stages. A program 
has 20% branch in0structions which execute in the EX stage and produce the next instruction pointer 
at the end of the EX stage in the old design and at the end of the EX2 stage in the new design. The 
IF stage stalls after fetching a branch instruction until the next instruction pointer is computed. All 
instructions other than the branch instruction have an average CPI of one in both the designs. The 
execution times of this program on the old and the new design are P and Q nanoseconds, 
resCpectively. The value of P/Q is ____.

Question:
The memory access time is 1 nanosecond for a read operation with a hit in cache, 5 nanoseconds 
for a read operation with a miss in cache, 2 nanoseconds for a write operation with a hit in cache 
and 10 nanoseconds for a write operation with a miss in cache. Execution of a sequence of 
instructions involves 100 instruction fetch operations, 60 memory operand read operations and 40 
memory operand write operations. The cache hit-ratio is 0.9.  The average memory access time (in 
nanoseconds) in executing the sequence of instructions is   ____.
