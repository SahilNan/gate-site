Question:
Consider the following relation on subsets of the set S of integers between 1 and 2014. For two 
distinct subsets U and V of S we say U < V  if the minimum element in the symmetric difference of 
the two sets is in U.

 S1: There is a subset of S that is larger than every other subset. 
 S2: There is a subset of S that is smaller than every other subset. 

Which one of the following is CORRECT?
Options:
(A) Both S1 and S2 are true 
(B) S1 is true and S2 is false 
(C) S2 is true and S1 is false 
(D) Neither S1 nor S2 is true

the result of joins. Which one of the following queries always gives the same answer as the nested 
query shown below:  

    select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)
Options:
(A) select R.* from R, S where R.a = S.a 
(B) select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a = S.a 
(C) select R.* from R,(select distinct a from S) as S1 where   
    R.a = S1.a 
(D) select R.* from R,S where R.a = S.a and is unique R

Question:
Consider a main memory system that consists of 8 memory modules attached to the system bus, 
which is one word wide. When a write request is made, the bus is occupied for 100 nanoseconds 
(ns) by the data, address, and control signals. During the same 100 ns, and for 500 ns thereafter, the 
addressed memory module executes one cycle accepting and storing the data. The (internal) 
operation of different memory modules may overlap in time, but only one request can be on the bus 
at any time. The maximum number of stores (of one word each) that can be initiated in 1 
millisecond is ____
