Question:
Consider a 128 x 10<sup>3</sup> bits/second satellite communication link with one way propagation delay
of 150 milliseconds. Selective retransmission (repeat) protocol is used on this link to send
data with a frame size of 1 kilobyte. Neglect the transmission time of acknowledgement. The
minimum number of bits required for the sequence number field to achieve 100% utilization
is ____ .
