Consider an instruction pipeline with five stages without any branch prediction: Fetch Instruction 
(FI), Decode Instruction (DI), Fetch Operand (FO), Execute Instruction (EI) and Write Operand 
(WO). The stage delays for FI, DI, FO, EI and WO are 5 ns, 7 ns, 10 ns, 8 ns and 6 ns, respectively. 
There are intermediate storage buffers after each stage and the delay of each buffer is 1 ns. A 
program consisting of 12 instructions I1, I2, I3, ..., I12 is executed in this pipelined processor. 
Instruction I4 is the only branch instruction and its branch target is I9. If the branch is taken during 
the execution of this program, the time (in ns) needed to complete the program is

Question:
The following code segment is executed on a processor which allows only register operands in its 
instructions.  Each instruction can have atmost two source operands and one destination operand. Assume 
that all variables are dead after this code segment. 
 
c = a + b; 
d = c * a; 
e = c + a; 
x = c * c; 
if (x > a) { 
   y = a * a; 
} 
else { 
   d = d * d; 
   e = e * e; 
} 

Suppose the instruction set architecture of the processor has only two registers. The only allowed 
compiler optimization is code motion, which moves statements from one place to another while 
preserving correctness. What is the minimum number of spills to memory in the compiled code?
Options:
(A) 0 
(B) 1 
(C) 2 
(D) 3

Question:
The procedure given below is required to find and replace certain characters inside an input character string 
supplied in array A.  The characters to be replaced are supplied in array oldc, while their respective 
replacement characters are supplied in array newc. Array A has a fixed length of five characters, while 
 arrays oldc and newc contain three characters each. However, the procedure is flawed.  

void find_and_replace (char *A, char *oldc, char *newc) { 
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) 
        for (int j=0; j<3; j++)  
            if (A[i] == oldc[j])  A[i] = newc[j]; 
}  
 
The procedure is tested with the following four test cases. 
 
(1)   oldc = "abc", newc = "dab"                 (2)   oldc = "cde", newc = "bcd" 
(3)   oldc = "bca", newc = "cda"                 (4)   oldc = "abc", newc = "bac" 

The tester now tests the program on all input strings of length five consisting of characters 'a', 
'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e' with duplicates allowed. If the tester carries out this testing with the four 
test cases given above, how many test cases will be able to capture the flaw?
Options:
(A) Only one 
(B) Only two 
(C) Only three   
(D) All four

Question:
A computer uses 46-bit virtual address, 32-bit physical address, and a three-level paged page table 
organization. The page table base register stores the base address of the first-level table (T1), which 
occupies exactly one page. Each entry of T1 stores the base address of a page of the second-level table (T2). 
Each entry of T2 stores the base address of a page of the third-level table (T3). Each entry of T3 stores a page 
table entry (PTE). The PTE is 32 bits in size. The processor used in the computer has a 1 MB 16-way set 
associative virtually indexed physically tagged cache. The cache block size is 64 bytes.

Question:
After several defeats in wars, Robert Bruce went in exile and wanted to commit suicide. Just before 
committing suicide, he came across a spider attempting tirelessly to have its net. Time and again, 
the spider failed but that did not deter it to refrain from making attempts. Such attempts by the 
spider made Bruce curious. Thus, Bruce started observing the near-impossible goal of the spider to 
have the net. Ultimately, the spider succeeded in having its net despite several failures. Such act of 
the spider encouraged Bruce not to commit suicide. And then, Bruce went back again and won 
many a battle, and the rest is history.
