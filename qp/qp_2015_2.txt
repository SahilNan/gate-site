Question:
Consider the sequence of machine instructions given below:

MUL  R5, R0, R1
DIV  R6, R2, R3
ADD  R7, R5, R6
SUB  R8, R7, R4

In the above sequence, R0 to R8 are general purpose registers. In the instructions shown, the first
register stores the result of the operation performed on the second and the third registers. This
sequence of instructions is to be executed in a pipelined instruction processor with the following 4
stages: (1) Instruction Fetch and Decode (IF), (2) Operand Fetch (OF), (3) Perform Operation (PO)
and (4) Write back the result (WB). The IF, OF and WB stages take 1 clock cycle each for any
instruction. The PO stage takes 1 clock cycle for ADD or SUB instruction, 3 clock cycles for MUL
instruction and 5 clock cycles for DIV instruction. The pipelined processor uses operand
forwarding from the PO stage to the OF stage. The number of clock cycles taken for the execution

Question:
Consider a processor with byte-addressable memory. Assume that all registers, including Program
Counter (PC) and Program Status Word (PSW), are of size 2 bytes. A stack in the main memory is
implemented from memory location (0100)<sub>16</sub> and it grows upward. The stack pointer (SP) points to
the top element of the stack. The current value of SP is (016E)<sub>16</sub>. The CALL instruction is of two
words, the first word is the op-code and the second word is the starting address of the subroutine
(one word = 2 bytes). The CALL instruction is implemented as follows:

  Store the current value of PC in the stack
  Store the value of PSW register in the stack
  Load the starting address of the subroutine in PC

The content of PC just before the fetch of a CALL instruction is (5FA0)<sub>16</sub>. After execution of the
CALL instruction, the value of the stack pointer is
Options:
(A) (016A)<sub>16</sub> 
(B) (016C)<sub>16</sub> 
(C) (0170)<sub>16</sub> 
(D) (0172)<sub>16</sub>

Question:
Consider the alphabet &sum; = {0, 1}, the null/empty string &lambda; and the sets of strings X<sub>0</sub>, X<sub>1</sub>, and X<sub>2</sub>

follows.

X<sub>0</sub> = 1X<sub>1</sub>
X<sub>1</sub> = 0X<sub>1</sub> + 1X<sub>2</sub>
X<sub>2</sub> = 0X<sub>1</sub> + {&lambda;}
