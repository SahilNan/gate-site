Question:
Two hosts are connected via a packet switch with 10<sup>7</sup> bits per second links. Each link has a
propagation delay of 20 microseconds. The switch begins forwarding a packet 35 microseconds
after it receives the same. If 10000 bits of data are to be transmitted between the two hosts using a
packet size of 5000 bits, the time elapsed between the transmission of the first bit of data and the
reception of the last bit of the data in microseconds is ____
