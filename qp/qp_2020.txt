Question:
The dawn of the 21st century witnessed the melting glaciers oscillating between giving too
much and too little to billions of people who depend on them for fresh water. The UN
climate report estimates that without deep cuts to man-made emissions, at least 30% of the
northern hemisphere's surface permafrost could melt by the end of the century. Given this
situation of imminent global exodus of billions of people displaced by rising seas, nation-
states need to rethink their carbon footprint for political concerns, if not for environmental
ones.
Which one of the following statements can be inferred from the given passage?
Options:
(A) Nation-states do not have environmental concerns.
(B) Nation-states are responsible for providing fresh water to billions of 
    people.
(C) Billions of people are responsible for man-made emissions.
(D) Billions of people are affected by melting glaciers.

Question:
Consider a non-pipelined processor operating at 2.5 GHz. It takes 5 clock cycles
to complete an instruction. You are going to make a 5-stage pipeline out of this
processor. Overheads associated with pipelining force you to operate the pipelined
processor at 2 GHz. In a given program, assume that 30% are memory
instructions, 60% are ALU instructions and the rest are branch instructions.
5% of the memory instructions cause stalls of 50 clock cycles each due to cache
misses and 50% of the branch instructions cause stalls of 2 cycles each. Assume
that there are no stalls associated with the execution of ALU instructions. For this
program, the speedup achieved by the pipelined processor over the non-pipelined
processor (round off to 2 decimal places) is ____ .


Question:
A processor has 64 registers and uses 16-bit instruction format. It has two types of

opcode and two register names. If there are 8 distinct I-type opcodes, then the
maximum number of distinct R-type opcodes is ____ .
