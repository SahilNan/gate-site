Question:
Consider a computer system with multiple shared resource types, with one instance
per resource type. Each instance can be owned by only one process at a time.
Owning and freeing of resources are done by holding a global lock (L). The following
scheme is used to own a resource instance :

function OWNRESOURCE(Resource R)
    Acquire lock L // a global lock
    if R is available then
        Acquire R
        Release lock L
    else
        if R is owned by another process P then
            Terminate P, after releasing all resources owned by P
            Acquire R.
            Restart P
            Release lock L
        end if
    end if
end function

Which of the following choice(s) about the above scheme is/are correct'?
Options:
(A) The scheme ensures that deadlocks will not occur.
(B) The scheme may lead to live-lock.
(C) The scheme may lead to starvation.
(D) The scheme violates the mutual exclusion property.

Question:
Consider a computer network using the distance vector routing algorithm in its
network layer. The partial topology of the network is as shown below.

<img src="img/2021_2_45.png" width="100px" height="100px" />

The objective is to find the shortest-cost path from the router R to routers P and Q.
Assume that R does not initially know the shortest routes to P and Q. Assume that
R has three neighbouring routers denoted as X, Y, and Z. During one iteration,
R measures its distance to its neighbours X, Y, and Z as 3, 2, and 5, respectively.
Router FR gets routing vectors from its neighbours that indicate that the distance
to router P from routers X, Y, and Z are 7, 6, and 5, respectively. The routing
vector also indicates that the distance to router Q from routers X, Y, and Z are
4, 6, and 8, respectively. Which of the following statement(s) is/are correct with
respect to the new routing table of R, after updation during this iteration?
Options:
(A) The distance from R to P will be stored as 10.
(B) The distance from R to Q will be stored as 7.
(C) The next hop router for a packet from R to P is Y.
(D) The next hop router for a packet from R to Q is Z.

Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). Each stage
of the pipeline, except the EX stage, takes one cycle. Assume that the ID stage
