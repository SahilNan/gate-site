Question:
The country of Zombieland is in distress since more than 75% of its working 
population is suffering from serious health issues. Studies conducted by competent 
health experts concluded that a complete lack of physical exercise among its 
working population was one of the leading causes of their health issues. As one of 
the measures to address the problem, the Government of Zombieland has decided 
to provide monetary incentives to those who ride bicycles to work.  

Based only on the information provided above, which one of the following 
statements can be logically inferred with certainty?
Options:
(A) All the working population of Zombieland will henceforth ride bicycles to work. 
(B) Riding bicycles will ensure that all of the working population of Zombieland is free 
    of health issues. 
(C) The health experts suggested to the Government of Zombieland to declare riding 
    bicycles as mandatory. 
(D) The Government of Zombieland believes that riding bicycles is a form of physical 
    exercise.

Question:
A keyboard connected to a computer is used at a rate of 1 keystroke per second.
The computer system polls the keyboard every 10 ms (milli seconds) to check for
a keystroke and consumes 100 &mu;s (micro seconds) for each poll. If it is determined
after polling that a key has been pressed, the system consumes an additional 200
&mu;s to process the keystroke. Let T1 denote the fraction of a second spent in polling
and processing a keystroke.

interrupt and processing a keystroke. Let T2 denote the fraction of a second spent
in servicing the interrupt and processing a keystroke.
