Question:
A hard disk has 63 sectors per track, 10 platters each with 2 recording surfaces and 1000 cylinders. The address
of a sector is given as a triple (c,h, s) , where c is the cylinder number, h is the surface number and s is the
sector number. Thus, the 0<sup>th</sup> sector is addressed as (0, 0, 0) , the 1<sup>st</sup> sector as (0, 0, 1) , and so on.

Question:
A sub-sequence of a given sequence is just the given sequence with some elements (possibly none or all) left
out. We are given two sequences X[m] and Y[n] of lengths m and n, respectively, with indexes of X and Y
starting from 0.

We wish to find the length of the longest common sub-sequence (LCS) of X[m] and Y[n] as
l(m, n), where an incomplete recursive definition for the function l(i, j) to compute the length of
the LCS of X[m] and Y[n] is given below:

    l(i,j) = 0 , if either i = 0 or j = 0
           = expr1 , if i, j > 0 and X[i-1] = Y[j-1]
           = expr2 , if i, j > 0 and X[i-1] &ne; Y[j-1]

Which one of the following options is correct ?
Options:
(A) expr1 = l(i - 1, j) + 1
(B) expr1 = l(i, j - 1)
(C) expr2 = max(l(i - 1, j), l(i, j - 1))
(D) expr2 = max(l(i - 1, j - 1), l(i, j))

Question:
A sub-sequence of a given sequence is just the given sequence with some elements (possibly none or all) left
out. We are given two sequences X[m] and Y[n] of lengths m and n, respectively, with indexes of X and Y
starting from 0.

The values of l(i, j) could be obtained by dynamic programming based on the correct recursive
definition of l(i, j) of the form given above, using an array L[M, N],where M = m + 1 and
N = n + 1, such that L[i, j] = l(i, j).

Which one the following statements would be TRUE regarding the dynamic programming solution for
the recursive definition of l(i, j) ?
Options:
(A) All elements of L should be initialized to 0 for the values of l(i, j) to be properly computed.
(B) The values of l(i, j) may be computed in a row major order or column major order of L[M, N] .
(C) The values of l(i, j) cannot be computed in either row major order or column major order of
L[M, N] .
(D) L[p, q] needs to be computed before L[r, s] if either p < r or q < s.


Question:

(A) The schema is in BCNF.
