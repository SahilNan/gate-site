Question:
A TCP server application is programmed to listen on port number P on host S. A
TCP client is connected to the TCP server over the network.
Consider that while the TCP connection was active, the server machine S crashed
and rebooted. Assume that the client does not use the TCP keepalive timer.

Which of the following behaviors is/are possible?
Options:
(A) If the client was waiting to receive a packet, it may wait indefinitely.
(B) The TCP server application on S can listen on P after reboot.
(C) If the client sends a packet after the server reboot, it will receive a RST segment.
(D) If the client sends a packet after the server reboot, it will receive a FIN segment.


Question:
Consider two hosts P and Q connected through a router R. The maximum transfer
unit (MTU) value of the link between P and R is 1500 bytes, and between R and
Q is 820 bytes.

A TCP segment of size 1400 bytes was transferred from P to Q through R, with IP
identification value as 0x1234. Assume that the IP header size is 20 bytes. Further,
the packet is allowed to be fragmented, i.e., Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IP
header is not set by P.

Which of the following statements is/are correct?
Options:
(A) Two fragments are created at R and the IP datagram size carrying the second
    fragment is 620 bytes.
(B) If the second fragment is lost, R will resend the fragment with the IP identification
    value 0x1234.
(C) If the second fragment is lost, P is required to resend the whole TCP segment.
(D) TCP destination port can be determined by analysing only the second fragment.


Question:
Consider the following pseudocode, where S is a semaphore initialized to 5 in line#2
and counter is a shared variable initialized to 0 in line##1. Assume that the incre-
ment operation in line#7 is not atomic.

2.  Semaphore S = init(5);
3.  void parop(void)
4.  {
5.    wait(S);
6.    wait(S);
7.    counter++;
8.    signal (S) ;
9.    signal (S) ;
10. }

If five threads execute the function parop concurrently, which of the following
program behavior(s) is/are possible?
Options:
(A) The value of counter is 5 after all the threads successfully complete the execution
    of parop.
(B) The value of counter is 1 after all the threads successfully complete the execution
    of parop.
(C) The value of counter is 0 after all the threads successfully complete the execution
    of parop.
(D) There is a deadlock involving all the threads.

Question:
Consider a dynamic hashing approach for 4-bit integer keys:

1. There is a main hash table of size 4.
2. The 2 least significant bits of a key is used to index into the main hash table.
3. Initially, the main hash table entries are empty.
4. Thereafter, when more keys are hashed into it, to resolve collisions, the set of
   all keys corresponding to a main hash table entry is organized as a binary tree
   that grows on demand.
5. First, the 3rd least significant bit is used to divide the keys into left and right
   subtrees.
6. To resolve more collisions, each node of the binary tree is further sub-divided
   into left and right subtrees based on the 4th least significant bit.
7. A split is done only if it is needed, i.e., only when there is a collision.

Consider the following state of the hash table.

hash table (assume the keys are in decimal notation)?
Options:
(A) 5, 9, 4, 13, 10, 7
(B) 9, 5, 10, 6, 7, 1
(C) 10, 9, 6, 7, 5, 13

Question:
Consider the sliding window flow-control protocol operating between a sender and
a receiver over a full-duplex error-free link. Assume the following:

 The time taken for processing the data frame by the receiver is negligible.
 The time taken for processing the acknowledgement frame by the sender is neg-
 ligible.
 The sender has infinite number of frames available for transmission.
 The size of the data frame is 2,000 bits and the size of the acknowledgement
 frame is 10 bits.
