word size is 4 bytes. The memory system uses a 60-MHz clock. To service a cache miss, the
memory controller first takes 1 cycle to accept the starting address of the block, it then takes
3 cycles to fetch all the eight words of the block, and finally transmits the words of the
requested block at the rate of 1 word per cycle. The maximum bandwidth for the memory
system when the program running on the processor issues a series of read operations is
